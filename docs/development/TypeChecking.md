# Type Checking

The CSE code is statically type-checked with [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org){target=_new}. 

Just execute the `mypy` command in the project's root directory and make sure that the [mypy.ini](https://github.com/ankraft/ACME-oneM2M-CSE/tree/master/mypy.ini) file is present. The configuration file contains the setting for the type-checking process.

```sh title="Run mypy in the project's root directory"
mypy
```
